At the end of this analysis, we should be able to perfectly give perspectives to the trends and patterns accompanying products sales and reviews by customers on Amazon, thus, helping us to make meaningful prescriptions on product improvement strategies.

### Data Source
The primary source of data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online platform such as kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.
