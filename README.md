## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview 
This project aims to analyse product and customer review data of sellers on Amazon to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. At the end of this analysis, we should be able to perfectly give perspectives to the trends and patterns accompanying products sales and reviews by customers on Amazon, thus, helping us to make meaningful prescriptions on product improvement strategies.

### Data Source
The primary source of data used here is Amazon case study.xlsx and this data was pooled directly from the Amazon platform and shared by the data analysis facilitator to all students for the project assessment.
